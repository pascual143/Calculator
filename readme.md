#Refactoring Lab

### Introduction

You task is to take the `starter-code` provided, and refactor it using the methodology we looked at in the previous lesson. You do not need to add any further functionality to the calculator.

**Note:** The calculator can only handle 2 numbers at a time, and can't handle double digits, i.e you **can** do `2 x 2` but you **can't** do `2 x 2 x 2` or `10 + 10`.

### Instructions

* Store the DOM elements in variables
* Use named functions
* Create a `setup` function, that gets called when the DOM is loaded
